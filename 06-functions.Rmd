# User Functions



We'd like a way to package our code so that it is easier to reuse, and Python provides for this by letting us define things called 'functions' a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code. Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_celsius` that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
```

![The Blueprint for a Python Function](assets/python-function.png)


The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the
name of the function (`fahr_to_celsius`) and a parenthesized list of parameter names (`temp`). The body of the function, the statements that are executed when it runs is indented below the definition line.  The body concludes with a `return` keyword followed by the return value.

When we call the function, the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables so that we can use them inside the function. Inside the function, we use a return statement to send a result back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
fahr_to_celsius(32)
```

This command should call our function, using "32" as the input and return the function value.

In fact, calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:
```{python, highlight = TRUE}
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(212), 'C')
```

We've successfully called the function that we defined,
and we have access to the value that we returned.


## Composing Functions

Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Celsius,
we can also write the function to turn Celsius into Kelvin:

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0.))
```

What about converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin? We could write out the formula,
but we don't need to. Instead, we can compose the two functions we have already created:
```{python, highlight = TRUE}

def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))
```


This is our first taste of how larger programs are built, we define basic operations, then combine them in ever-large chunks to get the effect we want.

## Variables Inside and Outside Functions

The function is insulated from the rest of the program. Things that happen in there don't affect what goes on elsewhere. Meaning we can re-use variable names inside the function that we used elsewhere without polluting them. Look what happens when the following piece of code is run

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
f = 0
k = 0

def f2k(f):
    k = ((f-32)*(5.0/9.0)) + 273.15
    return k

print( f2k(8) )
print( f2k(41) )
print( f2k(32) )

print(k)
```

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
259.81666666666666
287.15
273.15
0
```

`k` is 0 because the `k` inside the function `f2k` doesn't know about the `k` defined outside the function.


## Quiz

1. "Adding" two strings produces their concatenation `'a' + 'b'` is `'ab'`. Write a function called `fence` that takes two parameters called `original` and `wrapper`  and returns a new string that has the wrapper character at the beginning and end of the original. A call to your function should look like this:

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
print(fence('name', '*'))
```


2. Note that `return` and `print` are not interchangeable.`print` is a Python function that *prints* data to the screen. It enables us, *users*, see the data. `return` statement, on the other hand, makes data visible to the program.

Let's have a look at the following function:

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
def add(a, b):
   print(a + b)
```

What will we see if we execute the following commands?

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
A = add(7, 3)
print(A)
```

3. If the variable `s` refers to a string, then `s[0]` is the string's first character and `s[-1]` is its last. Write a function called `outer`  that returns a string made up of just the first and last characters of its input. A call to your function should look like this:

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
print(outer('helium'))
```
4. Rescaling an Array

Write a function `rescale` that takes a list as input  and returns a corresponding list of values scaled to lie in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

(Hint: If `L` and `H` are the lowest and highest values in the original array, then the replacement for a value `v` should be `(v-L) / (H-L)`. The `max()` function returns the biggest value in a list)

5. Consider this code:

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a = 3
b = 7

def swap(a, b):
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp

swap(a, b)

print(a, b)
```

Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code?  Why did you pick this answer?

 1. `7 3`
 2. `3 7`
 3. `3 3`
 4. `7 7`
