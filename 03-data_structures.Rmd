# Data Structures




1. Questions:
  - How do I arrange and process lots of data in Python?
2. Objectives:
  - Create and work with `lists` and `dicts`
  - Using loops and conditionals to make decisions
3. Keypoints:
  - variables are handy names for data objects
  - variables are used in functions
  - functions can be stored in packages
  - methods available depend on the object we're talking about


## Lists

Like most programming languages Python has some built in data structures that we can use.

Data structures are collection types that group lots of data into a single object and make working with lots of data easier. The simplest data structure is a `list`. We can create a list simply by enclosing our data in square brackets.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
my_list = [1,3,5,7]
print( my_list )
```

More often, though, we'll get a `list` as the result of a function. Recall the `numpy` function we used earlier. 

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
import numpy
numbers = numpy.arange(15)

print( numbers )
```

### List use

Lists can mix up any sort of data type,

```{python, highlight = TRUE}

numbers_and_letters = [1,2, 'three', 'IV', 5.0 ]
print( numbers_and_letters )

```

including other lists.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}

list_of_lists = [ [1,2,3], ["a","b","c"] ]

print( list_of_lists )

```

List elements can be accessed using indexing, like with strings.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
print( numbers_and_letters[0] )
print( numbers_and_letters[2:3] )
````

Indexing an element returns the whole element - so if that element happens to be a list itself - you get a whole list back

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
print( list_of_lists[1] )
```

To get at a single element you must use double square brackets.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
print( list_of_lists[0][1] )
print( list_of_lists[1][0] )
```

## Dictionaries

Another very common data structure is a dictionary. A dictionary is a data structure that has many unique `keys`, each of which refers to a bit of other data called a `value`. We can construct them using the curly brackets and the `key/value` pairs


```{python, highlight = TRUE}

my_dict = {
  "key1" : "value1",
  "key2" : "value2"
}

print( my_dict )
```

Note the order in the dictionary isn't preserved. We can use the square brackets to get a single value, but as a dictionary has no order or index, we must use the key.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}

print( my_dict["key1"] )

```
Dictionaries are useful when you want to ask for a bit of data by some name, rather than by its position in a list. 

Dictionaries can hold anything in their values. But keys are restricted to particular datatypes. Strings and numbers are good keys, lists are not allowed.

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
print( { ["list_key", 1, 2] : ["some data"]  } )

```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

## Quiz

1. Given the list below, use slicing to access only the last four entries.

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
list_for_slicing = [["fluorine", "F"], 
                    ["chlorine", "Cl"], 
                    ["bromine", "Br"], 
                    ["iodine", "I"], 
                    ["astatine", "At"]]
```

2. Can you work out how to correct the wrong data in the dictionary below? Try to think of a way that _doesn't_ involve re-writing the whole dictionary. Hint: can you assign straight to a key?

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
seasons = {
  'spring' : ['mar', 'apr', 'may' ],
  'autumn' : ['jun', 'jul', 'aug'],
  'winter' : ['dec', 'jan', 'feb']
}
```

3. Add in the missing season.
