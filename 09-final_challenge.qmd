# Putting It All Together

## A Challenge in Python

This file [SRR020192.fastq.gz](assets/SRR020192.fastq.gz) contains next generation sequencing reads in `fastq` format.

Write a Python script that uses the BioPython package to

  1. Count the reads in the `fastq` file
  2. Filter out low-quality reads from the `fastq` file
  3. Calculate how many reads are retained
  4. Use at least one user-defined function
