# Making Choices and Controlling Program Flow



How can we use Python to automatically recognize differences in data such that it can change what code is run depending on the data and take a different action for each? In this chapter, we'll learn how to write code that runs only when certain conditions are true.

## Conditionals

We can ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, with an `if` statement:

```{python, highlight = TRUE, fig.show = "hold"}
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
else:
    print('not greater')
```

The second line of this code uses the keyword `if` to tell Python that we want to make a choice. If the test that follows the `if` statement is true, the body of the `if` (i.e., the lines indented underneath it) are executed. If the test is false, the body of the `else` is executed instead. Only one or the other is ever executed:

The diagram below shows how this choice is being made.

Conditional statements don't have to include an `else`. If there isn't one, Python simply does nothing if the test is false:

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
num = 53
print('before conditional...')
if num > 100:
    print(num,' is greater than 100')
print('...after conditional')
```

We can also chain several tests together using `elif`,
which is short for "else if". The following Python code uses `elif` to print the sign of a number.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
num = -3

if num > 0:
    print(num, 'is positive')
elif num == 0:
    print(num, 'is zero')
else:
    print(num, 'is negative')
```

Note that the `if` and `elif` bits are mutually exclusive. Only one of them ever gets executed. 

### Testing equality

Note that to test for equality we use a double equals sign `==` rather than a single equals sign `=` which is already used to assign values.

## Logical operators

Python has all the standard logical operators that let us combine tests. Most commonly there is `and` and `or`. `and` is only true if both parts are true:

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
if (1 > 0) and (-1 > 0):
    print('both parts are true')
else:
    print('at least one part is false')
```

while `or` is true if at least one part is true:

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
if (1 < 0) or (-1 < 0):
    print('at least one test is true')
```

### What is True and what is False
True and `False`
`True` and `False` are special words in Python called `booleans`, which represent truth values. A statement such as `1 < 0` returns  the value `False`, while `-1 < 0` returns the value `True`.

`True` and `False` booleans are not the only values in Python that are true and false. In fact, *any* value can be used in an `if` or `elif`. After reading and running the code below, explain what the rule is for which values are considered true and which are considered false.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
if '':
    print('empty string is true')
if 'word':
    print('word is true')
if []:
    print('empty list is true')
if [1, 2, 3]:
    print('non-empty list is true')
if 0:
     print('zero is true')
if 1:
    print('one is true')
```

## That's Not Not What I Meant

Sometimes it is useful to check whether some condition is not true. The Boolean operator `not` can do this explicitly. After reading and running the code below, write some `if` statements that use `not` to test the rule that you formulated in the previous challenge.

```{python, highlight = TRUE}
if not '':
    print('empty string is not true')
if not 'word':
    print('word is not true')
if not not True:
    print('not not True is true')
```

## Quiz

1. Consider this code:

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if 4 > 5:
    print('A')
elif 4 == 5:
    print('B')
elif 4 < 5:
    print('C')
```

Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code? Why did you pick this answer?

  *  A
  *  B
  *  C
  *  B and C

2. Consider this code:

```{python, highlight = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if 4 > 5:
    print('A')
if 4 <= 5:
    print('B')
if 4 < 5:
    print('C')
```

Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code? Why did you pick this answer?
